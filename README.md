# Tweet Emotion Recognition

This repository contains a project focused on recognizing emotions from tweets using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model. The project includes steps such as data preprocessing, tokenization, padding, label preparation, model training, and evaluation.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into the following parts:

1. **Setup and Imports**  
   Set up the environment and import necessary libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, and other essential modules for data handling and model building.

2. **Importing Data**  
   Load and preprocess the dataset containing tweets and their associated emotions. This involves data cleaning, text processing, and splitting into training and test sets.

3. **Tokenizer**  
   Tokenize the tweet text data to convert words into numerical values that can be fed into the RNN model. This step leverages the Keras `Tokenizer` for vectorizing the text.


4. **Padding and Truncating Sequences**  
   In order to feed the data into the RNN model, all sequences must be of the same length. This step involves padding shorter sequences with zeros or truncating longer sequences to a fixed length. The padding ensures uniformity in the input data, making it compatible with the model's architecture.

5. **Preparing Labels**  
   The labels, which represent different emotions, need to be converted into a format that can be used by the model. This typically involves one-hot encoding or integer encoding. For instance, emotions like "happy," "sad," "angry," etc., are encoded as numerical values so that the model can learn from them.

6. **Creating and Training RNN Model**  
   This step involves constructing the RNN model architecture using layers such as Embedding, LSTM, GRU, or SimpleRNN, and Dense layers. The model is compiled with a loss function (e.g., categorical crossentropy for multi-class classification) and an optimizer (e.g., Adam). Once the model architecture is defined, the training process begins, where the model learns patterns from the tokenized and padded sequences of tweets.

7. **Model Evaluation**  
   After training, the model is evaluated on the test dataset to measure its performance. Metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are calculated to assess how well the model can predict the correct emotion of a tweet. You can also visualize the model’s performance using confusion matrices or graphs of training/validation accuracy and loss.

## Results and Performance Metrics

The final trained model's performance will be evaluated based on various metrics, such as:

- **Accuracy**: The percentage of correct predictions made by the model.
- **Loss**: A measure of the model's error in prediction, calculated using the loss function during training.
- **Precision, Recall, and F1-Score**: These metrics provide insights into the model's performance across different emotion classes, especially for imbalanced datasets.

Visualization of training and validation metrics (e.g., accuracy and loss) over epochs will help understand if the model is overfitting or underfitting.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of tweets labeled with various emotions, such as "happy," "sad," "angry," and more. You can use public datasets like the **GoEmotions dataset** or **Sentiment140**, or you can collect and label your own data. Ensure the dataset is preprocessed, which includes cleaning the text by removing stop words, URLs, special characters, and other noise.

## Future Work

Potential areas for future improvement and exploration include:

- **Model Architecture Enhancements**: Experiment with advanced architectures such as Bidirectional LSTMs, GRUs, or Transformer-based models like BERT for better performance.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Conduct extensive hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model’s performance, including tuning the learning rate, batch size, and sequence length.
- **Data Augmentation**: Enhance the dataset by using data augmentation techniques like back-translation or synonym replacement to improve the model's generalization capabilities.
- **Deployment**: Deploy the model as a web application or API using platforms like Flask or FastAPI, making it accessible for real-time emotion prediction on new tweets.
- **Multilingual Support**: Extend the model to handle tweets in multiple languages by incorporating multilingual embeddings and datasets.
